# SMC and set-based computations
This is a 'hand-on' tutorial on the collaborative mathematics platform SageMathCloud (SMC). We use SMC in the context of reachability analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems. In the way, we encounter a mixture of numerical integration methods, convex analysis and polynomial optimization.
