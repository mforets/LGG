    "Dear organizer, \n",
    "I have recently started to work on a parameter synthesis problem for a biochemical system which presents nonlinear hybrid dynamics. This is in the context of my post-doc at the IMAG computer science department here at Grenoble, in the team led by Oded Maler. I would be delighted to visit the BCAM environment during this workshop. Any suggestions regarding cheap accommodation for students/post-docs would be appreciated. Thanks, Marcelo."
