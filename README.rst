There is an online `HTML documentation <http://mforets.github.io/LGG/doc/html/>`_.

For a local build of the HTML documentation, clone this repository and run::

sage -sh -c "make html"

The documentation in PDF format can be built with::

sage -sh -c "make latexpdf"

These commands shall be executed inside the ``/docs`` directory.

Browse the Jupyter notebooks available in the ``/examples`` folder in this repository. These can be displayed in a window embedded in github, but it is recommended to use the external nbviewer (there is a link at the top right of that window).
